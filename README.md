# BeCookies cookie-clicker

The [BeCookies](https://sanbimu.github.io/cookie-clicker) cookie-clicker is a game created by [Edgar Leon](https://github.com/edgarleon93), [Mike Incourt](https://github.com/vdemike) and Nathalie Appaerts. 

## Description 

The goal of this project made for [BeCode](https://becode.org/) was to consolidate the `html`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` skills we have acquired in our web developer training so far. It was also a perfect opportunity to train our teamworking skills and practice working with `git`. 

We had 5 days to complete this cookie-clicker game with the following features: 

- a creative twist on the classic cookie-clicker game with a nice and responsive design 
- the rules of the game 
- a button that increases the score everytime it's clicked
- a way to display the players current score 
- 3 bonusses (a multiplier, an autoclicker and a boost) 
- a way to display which bonusses the player has purchased, the price of the bonus and its effect and/or duration
- deactivate the bonus buttons when the player doesn't have enough clicks to buy them
- a possibility to reset the game
